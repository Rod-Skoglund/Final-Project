## **2. Week 2 Deliverables**

Week 2 deliverables are saved in the "Docs" subfolder.

Week 2 deliverables include:
- A functioning minimal viable product (i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function). This should be as close to a working app as possible and include:
- A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to instructors and TAs during class.
- A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.
